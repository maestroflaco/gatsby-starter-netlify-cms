As we draw near to the start of a new semester of dancing,  I want to invite you all to 2 free workshops taking place tomorrow at 6 & 7 pm., respectively.

These limited space offerings are for you as alums and friends of the dance!

The first is <strong>Latin Rhythms</strong>, which focuses on Latin dances that are easier to dance than Salsa taking place at 6 pm, and the second is <strong>Cuban Rueda de Casino at 7 pm,</strong> which can only be described by an experience!You gotta check this style! click here for all the deets:
